    <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract-</i>Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) which combines
    mobile computing and cloud computing, has become one of
    the industry buzz words and a major discussion thread in the
    IT world since 2009. As MCC is still at the early stage of
    development, it is necessary to grasp a thorough understanding
    of the technology in order to point out the direction of future
    research. With the latter aim, this paper presents a review on
    the background and principle of MCC, characteristics, recent
    research work, and future research trends. A brief account on the
    background of MCC: from mobile computing to cloud computing
    is presented and then followed with a discussion on characteristics
    and recent research work. It then analyses the features and
    infrastructure of mobile cloud computing. The rest of the paper
    analyses the challenges of mobile cloud computing, summary
    of some research projects related to this area, and points out
    promising future research directions.<br>

    <h4>I.&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</h4>
    
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, advances in the field of network
        based computing and applications on demand have led to
        an explosive growth of application models such as cloud
        computing, software as a service, community network, web
        store, and so on. As a major application model in the era of the
        Internet, Cloud Computing has become a significant research
        topic of the scientific and industrial communities since 2007.
        Commonly, cloud computing is described as a range of ser-
        vices which are provided by an Internet-based cluster system.
        Such cluster systems consist of a group of low-cost servers or
        Personal Computers (PCs), organizing the various resources
        of the computers according to a certain management strategy,
        and offering safe, reliable, fast, convenient and transparent
        services such as data storage, accessing and computing to
        clients. According to the top ten strategic technology trends
        for 2012 [1] provided by Gartner (a famous global analytical
        and consulting company), cloud computing has been on the
        top of the list, which means cloud computing will have an
        increased impact on the enterprise and most organizations in
        2012.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, smartphones are considered as the representa-
        tive for the various mobile devices as they have been connected
        to the Internet with the rapidly growing of wireless network
        technology. Ubiquity and mobility are two major features</p></div>

       <p>in the next generation network which provides a range of
        personalized network services through numerous network ter-
        minals and modes of accessing. The core technology of cloud
        computing is centralizing computing, services, and specific
        applications as a utility to be sold like water, gas or electricity
        to users. Thus, the combination of a ubiquities mobile net-
        work and cloud computing generates a new computing mode,
        namely Mobile Cloud Computing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;As an inheritance and development of cloud computing,
        resources in mobile cloud computing networks are virtualized
        and assigned in a group of numerous distributed computers
        rather than in traditional local computers or servers, and are
        provided to mobile devices such as smartphones, portable ter-
        minal, and so on. (see Fig. 1). Meanwhile, various applications
        based on mobile cloud computing have been developed and
        served to users, such as Googles Gmail, Maps and Navigation
        systems for Mobile, Voice Search, and some applications on
        an Android platform, MobileMe from Apple, Live Mesh from
        Microsoft, and MotoBlur from Motorola. According to the
        research from Juniper, the cloud computing based mobile
        software and application are expected to rise 88% annually
        from 2009 to 2014, and such growth may create US 9.5 billion
        dollars in 2014.
